#NYCapable
NYCapable is a project designed to make it easier for commuters to find the closest wheelchair-accessible MTA station. We hope that it will help an underserved population of the city quickly navigate the MTA system. This app provides:

- Directions to the 5 closest accessible subway stations from any given location with the exact location of ADA-compliant entrances and elevators
- Directions to and from any location

You can find the current version on Heroku [here](https://limitless-temple-7688.herokuapp.com/). We believe that this project is just the beginning, and we'd love for you to contribute in a project that can help open up the transit
system to everyone.

###API Reference
-We used the [MTA Developer Resources](http://datamine.mta.info/) to get static and real-time information on routes and service status. We developed our own database to pinpoint the precise location of ADA-compliant entrances and elevators.

- We used the [Google Maps Places API](https://developers.google.com/places/) and the [Google Maps Javascript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/) for geolocation, directions, and map creation.
